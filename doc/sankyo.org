* Cheat Sheets
There is a [[http://hyperpolyglot.org/lisp][cheat sheet]] comparing all the 4 main lisps:
- Common Lisp (SBCL)
- Scheme (Racket)
- Clojure
- Emacs Lisp
It shows how each language implements a function or feature.
If you know what a function is called in one language, you can look
it up and see what the equivalents are in the other languages.

*** Sequence predicates
You can check each element of a sequence with a predicate using 
- every
- some
