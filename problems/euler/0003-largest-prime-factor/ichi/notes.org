#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of Largest Prime Factor

* 1st solution proposed
- keep getting lowest prime factor for number
- stop when product of all factors equal the number
- extract largest prime factor from list

* Retrospective
Tried a solution using global variables but it got more and more confusing.
The ideas was to memoize primes rather than recalculate them at the start
of each new prime factor calculation.

** Ways to improve
- only check for primes up to the square root of previous primes
- memoize k value and primes so the same k values and primes are not 
  recalculated

** Lessons
- should have leaned on test more heavily and early on would have prevented
  wasted time
- functional solutions seem easier to build up (probably because of ease of
  testing)
- the above would have helped focus on a bottom up design which would have
  created a working implementation more quickly
