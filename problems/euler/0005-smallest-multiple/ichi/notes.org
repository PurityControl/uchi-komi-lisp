#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of Smallest Multiple

* 1st solution proposed

- create a predicate returning true if 1 up to limit is divisible by the number
- create recursive function incrementing by largest number if predicate is
  not true otherwise returning the number

* Contracts

** methods
: common-multiple-p(number lo-numbers)
: smallest-multiple-for(lo-numbers)

* Retrospective
Another example of clarity brought out through recursion.
The first ruby implementation uses a lazy sequence implementation
which turns out to be unperformant.
This solution was very quick 

** Ways to improve
Not sure as I like the solution we have here.

** Lessons
- again bottom up thinking along with tests helps tease out the api
  quickly and cleanly
